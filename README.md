# Developer Portfolio V1: A New Approach to Tracking

Welcome to **Version 1** of my developer portfolio. This repository marks a significant shift in how I manage and iterate on my online presence. Instead of overwriting previous designs, I'm now maintaining **distinct, versioned repositories** for each major portfolio iteration. This new strategy allows for better historical tracking and streamlined deployments using **GitHub Actions**.

Crucially, this is also my **first portfolio hosted directly on GitHub Pages**, moving away from external hosting platforms like HostGator. This change further integrates the development and deployment workflow within GitHub.

This iteration showcases a clean, **bento-style layout** crafted with the modern web framework, **Astro.js**. It's designed to be minimal, highly performant, and responsively display my work, with styling heavily driven by **Tailwind CSS**.

### Why "V1"?

This designation signifies the first portfolio built under a new, structured approach to versioning and deployment. Future iterations will reside in their own dedicated repositories, making it easier to manage and showcase the evolution of my work over time.
