    <br />
    <p>
      I’m a Software Developer specializing in Front-End Web Development, with
      experience in building and deploying web applications, integrating APIs,
      and working with databases. I enjoy solving problems, collaborating with
      teams, and leveraging modern frameworks and tools to create efficient,
      user-friendly solutions.

      Outside of coding, I find inspiration in storytelling—whether through
      Manhwa, Webtoons, anime, or gaming. Lately, I’ve been enjoying the quiet
      escape of reading, but I never turn down a good online match with friends.
